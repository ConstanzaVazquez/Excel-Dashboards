# Excel-Dashboards
Here are my dashboards made with Excel. 

Before making the dashboards:
- Remove duplicates
- Check formating (currency, dates, numbers)
- Changing column names
- Fixing errors
- Delete columns that are not going to be used

Finally making use of the pivot tables to insert the graphics.

Last but not least important, make it look pretty! :)
